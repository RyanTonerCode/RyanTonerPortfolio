    <h1 class="display-1">About</h1>

    I attended the 36th International 
    <a href="http://2017.dasconline.org/" target="_blank">Digital Avionics Systems Conference</a> (DASC) in St. Petersburg, FL sponsored by a Travel Grant via NASA
    to present on behalf of my team's research on Wednesday, September 20th 2017. I had an amazing experience connecting with technical experts in avionics,
    and got the chance to see firsthand the new developments across avionics agencies and universities from around the world.
