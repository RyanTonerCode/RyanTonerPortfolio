        <h1 class="display-4">About this project</h1>
        My research was part of a Collaborative Research & Development Agreement with the Modeling and Simulation Branch of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
        Working with the Modeling & Simulation branch of the FAA and our Fairfield University team, this research took place over a seven month period starting in December 2016.
        The project began when members of the FAA came to Fairfield University to issue the problem statement and provided us with Linux machines with proprietary FAA Oracle databases containing large scale real flight datasets and software.
        We presented at the FAA in Atlantic City, NJ twice &mdash; at the midterm point and upon completion &mdash; and our final presentation was delivered to multiple FAA departments and team managers.

        Air Traffic Control (ATC) is tasked with preventing predicted conflicts (two or more aircraft expected within five nautical miles of the same lateral plane with maximum vertical offset of 100ft)
        for en route traffic over an altitude of 18,000 feet with several types of maneuvers.
        Using data generated by the Trajectory Conflict Probe (ERAM) along with a corresponding visualization tool called FliteViz4D,
        we generated and tested a valid algorithm for the classification of ATC commands issued to prevent the predicted conflicts.
        Along with coding the algorithm for specific conflict resolution classification,
        I created a generalized method for checking conflict permutations and devised a unique algorithm to identify simultaneous conflict predictions.
        This particular algorithm expanded the conflict groupings quantitatively beyond the probe's data limitation of two aircraft per conflict,
        which allowed the classifier to better analyze scenarios where ATC is issuing commands to actors in high traffic airspace.
        I also assisted in the creation of truth-like synthetic data to validate that the algorithm worked as expected.
        A challenge for me was ensuring that the large data set consisting of millions of cross-referenced entries was analyzed efficiently,
        and this required my effective usage of data structures and procedural loading to ensure the algorithms ran optimally.
        My particular analysis was on real data in the airspace over Washington DC (ARTCC ZDC) over a 24-hour time window.
        On this work, I co-authored a peer-reviewed paper entitled “Aircraft Conflict Resolution Cataloguer” that I presented on behalf of our team at the 36th DASC in St. Petersburg, Florida in September 2017.

        For this work, our research team was issued a Certificate of Appreciation from the FAA signed by Albert Schwartz and Mike Paglione.
