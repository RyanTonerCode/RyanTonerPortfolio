        A research area of personal interest to me is symbolic differentiation and computer algebra systems as a whole.
        I have created several prototypes of so called derivative calculators, which take mathematical functions
        and return the symbolic derivative. I have written two primary prototypes: a calculator which takes
        string-based inputs (which can be generated by a human or fed via a database), and secondly a
        graphical user interface version written in JavaFX with the ability for users to drag-and-drop
        mathematical expressions and edit them quickly.

        <h1 class="display-4 mb-3">Shunting-Yard to O(n) symbolic differentiation</h1>
        I have also experimented with various algorithms and data structures for the purpose of these derivative
        calculators. In my research, I came across Edsger Djikstra's Shunting-Yard algorithm, which is an O(n) method
        for symbolic expression parsing with deference to the order of operations. My research in this field has led me to
        expanding the Shunting-Yard algorithm to work for efficient, and perhaps parallelizable, symbolic
        derivative calculation bounded by O(n) time. I devised a pipelined algorithm with several key
        stages including a tokenization algorithm, a modified Shunting-Yard approach, and most-critically
        a method to return to infix notation while producing the derivative. Common functions are encoded using
        a HashMap method along with their derivative for constant lookup speed. All derivative rules apply
        and work with multivariable expressions, so the gradient of partial derivatives is extremely easy
        to generate. As such, the generalized chain-rule is of particular importance for multivariable composite functions.

        <h1 class="display-4 mb-3">Significance</h1>
        The significance of this work is that until this point, it has not been the case that the Shunting-Yard
        approach has been used for symbolic differentiation, and further that this algorithm is extremely
        fast on large data sets. I have a white paper in the works on this algorithm, and plan to submit it
        along with research data-based analysis to a computer algebra systems conference.
